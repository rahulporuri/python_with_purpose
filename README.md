Learning Python by solving real world problems

# Prerequisites

The code is written with Python 3.6 in mind. Note that running the code
will require a number of external packages to be installed.

If you don't already have a Python environment with the relevant packages
installed, please follow the following instructions :

```
$ edm envs create jupyter --version 3.6
$ edm install -e jupyter --yes jupyter notebook numpy pandas matplotlib
$ edm shell -e jupyter
$ cd /path/to/python_with_purpose
$ jupyter notebook
```

`edm` refers to `Enthought Deployment Manager`, which can be downloaded from
